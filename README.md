"House Price Prediction using Linear Regression"
This repository contains code for developing a machine learning model with linear regression to predict house prices. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (house features).

Steps to Develop the Model:
1. Data Collection:
Gather a dataset containing relevant information about houses, including features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.
3. Splitting the Data:
Divide the dataset into training and evaluation subsets to train and evaluate the model's performance.
4. Model Training:
Use the scikit-learn library to train a linear regression model on the training data, learning the relationship between house features and prices.
5. Model Evaluation:
Make predictions on the evaluation dataset and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. Fine-Tuning:
Optionally, fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters and exploring different feature combinations to improve performance.
7. Deployment:
Deploy the trained model to production for making predictions on new data, potentially using serialization techniques like pickle or joblib.
8. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Monitor the deployed model's performance in production and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure continued accuracy.
